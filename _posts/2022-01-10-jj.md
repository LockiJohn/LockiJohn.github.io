###Are we in a bubble?

#### 1923 to 1926
a bubble emerges the roaring 20s was
going pretty smoothly in america
electricity was becoming mainstream the
middle class was growing
radios cars factories were taking off
and the stock market was roaring higher
and higher without much volatility
investors made a nice 150 percent return
for the stock market from 1922 to 1927
with the hottest tech stocks at the time
leading the pack radio shack and general
motors
kind of similar to today success
prosperity wealth became the new normal
what of course i own some stocks what
sucker doesn't and what started out as a
legitimate stock market that was growing
due to real innovation new technology
and more productivity euphoric human
greed takes over and a bubble emerges
